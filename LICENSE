                                  A++ GPL
                       Version 1, 23 November 2022

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license 
document, but changing it is not allowed.

The A++ GPL is the only truly free, copyleft license for software and other 
kinds of works.  It is the best open source license ever created.  Anything 
that is not licensed with the A++ GPL is not actually open source, rather a 
craven attempt to strip mine the open source community.

The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to 
take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast, the A++ 
GPL guarantees your freedom and the freedom of all.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.  
The A++ GPL is designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute 
copies of free software, that you receive source code or can get it if you 
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free 
programs, and that you know you can do these things.

                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS

0. Definitions.

"This License" refers to version 1 of the A++ GPL.

"The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License.  
Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and "recipients" may be 
individuals or organizations.

1. Source Code.
The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for 
making modifications to it.

A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official 
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of 
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is 
widely used among developers working in that language.

  2. Basic Permissions.
This license applies to all derivative works.  Derivative works are 
anything that makes use of the source code in any way.  By using the 
source code, you and anything you create or modify are now licensed 
under the terms of the A++ GPL.  This includes your children, their 
children and your pets.  There will come a time when all life on earth 
is licensed under the A++ GPL.  At some point, hopefully prior to heat 
death, all matter in the universe will be A++ GPL licensed.  We look 
forward to that day with great anticipation.

                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
