# punch-buggy
These are the offical rules of the noble game of punch buggy.  They were agreed by the international punch buggy federation based in Tacoma, WA.

## Definition of a Buggy
A punch bug or buggy is a Volkswagen Beetle.  This includes:
* The [original beetle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volkswagen_Beetle)
* The [new beetle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volkswagen_New_Beetle)
* The [A5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volkswagen_New_Beetle)

## A Sighting
The game never ends.  It is played while driving in a car, sitting in a coffee shop or walking down the street.  If you let your guard down you lose.  When you sight a punch buggy, you maybe punch an opponent who is within five feet of you.  

* The buggy must be physically present.  Pictures do not count.
* The buggy must be running and have a driver in the driver seat.

## The Punch
Once a buggy is sighted you should punch your opponent.  The ideal punch is with a closed fist.  Some rotate their arm outward to issue a punch, though we at the committee find that inelegant, preffering a more traditional punch.

The point of the punch itself is not to physically disable your oppoent.  Rather, it is to give them a subtle reminder, slightly throbbing reminder that they have been bested by a greater player of the noble game of punch buggy.

## No Punch Backs
If you don't say "no punch backs" within two seconds on punching your opponent, they may punch you in reciprocation.  Note that this can lead to an endless stream of punches.  

In more vicious matches, some have been known to punch their opponent in the vocal cords, thereby disabling their "no punch back" ability and ensuring victor in the game.  Though, this strategy is generally frowned upon as unsporting behaviour.

## Repeated Sightings
When a buggy is sighted and a punch is issued, a ten minute timer begins.  If the buggy is visible after those 10 minutes have elapsed, you may once again punch your opponent.  Note that owners of buggies are advised to punch their passengers once every ten
